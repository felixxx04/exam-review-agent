> **Additional context needed**: what's appropriate for the domain (playful vs professional vs quirky vs elegant).

Find the moments where personality and unexpected polish would turn a functional interface into one users remember and tell other people about. Add only where the moment earns it; delight everywhere reads as noise.

## Register

Brand: delight can be distributed across copy voice, section transitions, discovery rewards, seasonal touches, personality across the whole surface.

Product: delight at specific moments, not pages. Completion, first-time actions, error recovery, milestone crossings. Reliability and consistency carry the rest of the experience; delight pushed everywhere reads as noise.

## Assess Delight Opportunities

Identify where delight would enhance (not distract from) the experience:

1. **Find natural delight moments**:
   - **Success states**: Completed actions (save, send, publish)
   - **Empty states**: First-time experiences, onboarding
   - **Loading states**: Waiting periods that could be entertaining
   - **Achievements**: Milestones, streaks, completions
   - **Interactions**: Hover states, clicks, drags
   - **Errors**: Softening frustrating moments
   - **Easter eggs**: Hidden discoveries for curious users

2. **Understand the context**:
   - What's the brand personality? (Playful? Professional? Quirky? Elegant?)
   - Who's the audience? (Tech-savvy? Creative? Corporate?)
   - What's the emotional context? (Accomplishment? Exploration? Frustration?)
   - What's appropriate? (Banking app ≠ gaming app)

3. **Define delight strategy**:
   - **Subtle sophistication**: Refined micro-interactions (luxury brands)
   - **Playful personality**: Whimsical illustrations and copy (consumer apps)
   - **Helpful surprises**: Anticipating needs before users ask (productivity tools)
   - **Sensory richness**: Satisfying sounds, smooth animations (creative tools)

If any of these are unclear from the codebase, STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify.

**CRITICAL**: Delight should enhance usability, never obscure it. If users notice the delight more than accomplishing their goal, you've gone too far.

## Delight Principles

Follow these guidelines:

### Delight Amplifies, Never Blocks
- Delight moments should be quick (< 1 second)
- Never delay core functionality for delight
- Make delight skippable or subtle
- Respect user's time and task focus

### Surprise and Discovery
- Hide delightful details for users to discover
- Reward exploration and curiosity
- Don't announce every delight moment
- Let users share discoveries with others

### Appropriate to Context
- Match delight to emotional moment (celebrate success, empathize with errors)
- Respect the user's state (don't be playful during critical errors)
- Match brand personality and audience expectations
- Cultural sensitivity (what's delightful varies by culture)

### Compound Over Time
- Delight should remain fresh with repeated use
- Vary responses (not same animation every time)
- Reveal deeper layers with continued use
- Build anticipation through patterns

## Delight Techniques

Add personality and joy through these methods:

### Micro-interactions & Animation
- Satisfying button press, ripple effect, smooth lift on hover
- Playful loading animations, personality in loading messages
- Checkmark draw animation, confetti burst for major achievements
- Icons that animate on hover, color shifts, tooltip reveals

### Personality in Copy
- Playful error messages matching brand voice
- Encouraging empty states
- Match copy personality to brand (banks can be warm, not wacky)

### Illustrations & Visual Personality
- Custom illustrations for empty/error/loading/success states
- Animated icons, consistent icon style
- Subtle particle effects, gradient mesh, time-of-day themes

### Satisfying Interactions
- Drag and drop delight, toggle switches, progress & achievements
- Input fields that animate on focus, checkboxes with satisfying pulse

### Sound Design
- Subtle audio cues when appropriate, respect system sound settings, provide mute option

### Easter Eggs & Hidden Delights
- Konami code, hidden shortcuts, hover reveals, console messages
- Seasonal touches, time-based changes, progressive reveals

### Loading & Waiting States
- Interesting loading messages that rotate (write product-specific ones, not generic AI filler)
- WARNING: Avoid cliched AI-slop loading messages like "Herding pixels", "Teaching robots to dance"

### Celebration Moments
- Confetti for milestones, animated checkmarks, personalized messages

**NEVER**:
- Delay core functionality for delight
- Force users through delightful moments (make skippable)
- Use delight to hide poor UX
- Overdo it (less is more)
- Ignore accessibility
- Sacrifice performance for delight
- Be inappropriate for context (read the room)

## Verify Delight Quality

Test that delight actually delights:

- **User reactions**: Do users smile? Share screenshots?
- **Doesn't annoy**: Still pleasant after 100th time?
- **Doesn't block**: Can users opt out or skip?
- **Performant**: No jank, no slowdown
- **Appropriate**: Matches brand and context
- **Accessible**: Works with reduced motion, screen readers

When the moments feel earned, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass.
